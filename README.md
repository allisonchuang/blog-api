# What I did
I got my app to connect to the database.

# What worked
Doing SA7 first made doing this lab much easier.

# Extra credit
I ordered my posts by most recent posts first. In addition, I added a timestamp to both my posts view and my individual post view. This was done by using the mongoose created_at method.
