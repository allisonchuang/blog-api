# What I did
In addition to the authentication required for this assignment, the user model also handles a username and profile picture url.
# What worked
It was easy to create the user model and user controller by modeling off of the post model and post controller.

# Extra credit
My user model handles a username and profile picture url and is supported by the rest of the backend. This information is taken during the signup process.
